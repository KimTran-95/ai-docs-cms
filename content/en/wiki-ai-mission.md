The ultimate goal of AIOZ is to create a blockchain-based decentralized AI protocol and ecosystem to tackle
following matters:
- **Privacy:** Making privacy-preserving AI technologies
(e.g., deep learning, statistics, etc.) accessible to consumers, GPU resource owners who supply data, and AI developers, who train models on that data.

- **Sensitive Products Possibility:** Utilizing untapped
private data for AI while preserving data privacy.
Given recent advanced development in cryptography,
AI-based solutions could be run without needing a
copy of data.

- **Decentralized Computing:** Connecting and leveraging individual devices' idle processing power for AI development.

- **Income:** Encouraging continuous improvement of
AI solutions by providing an effort-reward model
to stimulate contributions from developers to consumers/miners by utilizing the availability of
enormous amounts of computing resources in the
blockchain network.

- **Cost Affordability:** The cost of computing and storing data is one of the main expenditure items in products powered by AI. The use of distributed decentralized computing powers allows a significant reduction of infrastructure costs by involving miners in a decentralized computing network to perform AI solutions with the added benefit of offering miners other income-earning opportunities.

- **Productizable:** Keep AI models updated to real-life
problems by refining existing AI algorithms and models through crowdsourced fine-tuning model trainers.
