The growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is seemingly unabated at a remarkable rate, with a projected size of 15.7 trillion dollars as early as 2030, to become one of
the largest and most important markets in the world. However, the requirements for large annotated datasets, and a complex technical infrastructure have somehow driven AI
development behind the closed doors of corporations.

AT AIOZ, We aim to create a decentralized Optimization ecosystem and public AIOZ.AI protocol, where developers and consumers can harmoniously collaborate to benefit
each other and continuously contribute to the AI community, while putting privacy-preserving as one of the number one mission statement. With the aid of AIOZ.AI protocol, the AI algorithms not only can be trained on the untapped private data that it never has access to, but also leverage
the idle processing power of individual devices (from mobile/handheld devices to desktop/PC), in which resulting more precise predictions.

Developers, who wish to experiment with AI solutions on strong GPU machines or run analytical predictions can simply create appropriate algorithms, define a training bounty, then distribute over AIOZ.AI ecosystem under decentralized blockchain smart contract to request specific user
data and start the training progress by utilizing the computing power of miners on the network. Each participating node contributes to model parameter estimation without revealing any private information (i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across the network). Furthermore, our developers can also improve their algorithm and its predictability by the crowdsourced model trainers in the AIOZ.AI protocol.
